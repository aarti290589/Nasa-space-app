PROJECT SOLMAP - BY IMPACT CREW

SUMMARY

Our project focuses on utilizing NASA’s weather and environmental data to determine the optimal renewable energy production method for specific geographical locations. By analyzing climate patterns, atmospheric conditions, and geological features, we aim to match regions with the most efficient and sustainable energy source among solar, geothermal, tidal, and wind power. Solar energy potential can be assessed using satellite data on solar radiation and cloud cover, helping identify sun-rich regions such as deserts. Wind energy relies on wind speed and consistency, which can be mapped using atmospheric circulation and surface wind data. Geothermal energy requires insights into geological formations, fault lines, and heat flow, which NASA’s Earth observation datasets support through geophysical and tectonic studies. Tidal energy can be evaluated using oceanic data, including tidal ranges, wave intensity, and coastal geography. By integrating NASA’s data with local conditions, our project seeks to recommend the most efficient energy technology for each region, ensuring both environmental sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This approach not only supports renewable energy adoption but also contributes to energy security and climate resilience. Ultimately, the project bridges advanced space-based data with practical energy solutions tailored to the Earth’s diverse landscapes.

PROJECT DETAILS

Our project is designed to utilize solar energy as a sustainable renewable energy source for specific geographical regions by analyzing NASA’s weather, solar irradiance and environmental data. The project works by integrating Earth observation dataset that includes climate patterns, atmospheric conditions, and geological features to suggest regional location coordinates on earth that have optimal potential to garner the most out of solar radiation reaching earth.  

Benefits:

Data-driven energy planning: Enables better decision-making for governments, companies, and communities.
Environmental sustainability: Promotes the use of renewable energy that aligns with natural conditions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
Energy security and climate resilience: Supports long-term, sustainable infrastructure in the face of climate change.
Rural areas in developing countries often lack reliable energy access. Installing solar power in suitable locations can improve living conditions and support small businesses through sustainable, reliable electricity.
Intended Impact:
The project aims to accelerate global adoption of renewable energy technologies by making their implementation smarter and more regionally appropriate. It bridges space-based data with real-world energy needs, supporting a transition to clean energy while considering environmental factors. Long-term, it contributes to climate action, sustainability goals, and global energy equity.

Tools, Coding Languages, and Software Used:

Programming languages: Python (for data analysis), JavaScript (for visualization)
Data tools & libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly
Dataset: CERES Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) TOA and Surface Monthly means data in netCDF Edition 4.2.1
Software: Visual Studio Code
Optional AI tools: Gemini, Google AI Studio, Canva
Creativity in the Project:
Our project creatively combines Earth observation data with geospatial analysis and renewable energy research to solve a real-world problem. We created a dynamic, location-based recommendation system that adapts to environmental and geological variables. By using data for practical, Earth-based challenges, we connect space science with sustainable development.

Factors Considered by the Team:

Data availability and reliability from NASA Earthdata
Regional differences in energy potential (e.g., deserts vs. coasts)
Environmental impact and sustainability of energy source
Infrastructure requirements
Scalability of our approach for global use
Interdisciplinary integration of environmental science, geoscience, computer science, and renewable energy
USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)

 Code and data:  We used Gemini and Google AI Studio for Coding and Canva for making the presentation.
